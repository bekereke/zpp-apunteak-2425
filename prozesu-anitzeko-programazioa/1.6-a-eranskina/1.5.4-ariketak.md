# 1.5.4 Ariketak

1. Write a C program that creates a pipe, forks a child process, and sends a string message from the parent process to the child process through the pipe. The child process should then display the received message.
2. Create a FIFO named "myfifo" and write a C program that opens the FIFO for writing, prompts the user to enter a message, and writes the message to the FIFO. Another C program should open the FIFO for reading and display the received message.
3. Write a C program that creates two child processes. The parent process sends a message to the first child process, and the first child process sends the modified message to the second child process. The second child process should print the received message.
4. Write a C program that demonstrates pipe communication between parent and child processes, where the child process executes a command and redirects its output to the parent process. The parent process then reads the command's output from the pipe and displays it on the standard output. (use `dup2` function).
5. What is the output of the following code? explain why. (A)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
	if (fork() || fork())
		fork();
	printf("1 ");
	return 0;
}
```

6. What is the output of the following code? explain why. (B)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
    if (fork()) {
        if (!fork()) {
            fork();
            printf("1 ");
        }
        else {
            printf("2 ");
        }
    }
    else {
        printf("3 ");
    }
    printf("4 ");
    return 0;
}
```

7. What is the output of the following code? explain why. (C)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
  
int main()
{
    if (fork() && (!fork())) {
        if (fork() || fork()) {
            fork();
        }
    }
    printf("2 ");
    return 0;
}
```
